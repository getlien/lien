/**
 * Dedicated incomplete-handling candidate-loop (per-rule-loops design doc
 * §7 item 5, `.wip/per-rule-loops-design.md` in the design session's
 * worktree) — the second candidate loop, structurally mirroring the
 * stale-duplicate pilot (`stale-duplicate-pass.ts`, PR #803).
 *
 * `incomplete-handling` has THREE deterministic signals feeding the main
 * pass today, each covering a different omission shape (system-prompt.ts's
 * doc comment on `<incomplete-handling>` gating):
 *  - `variant-sweep-signals.ts` — an added enum member / union arm /
 *    const-object key whose consumer sites weren't updated.
 *  - `sibling-surface-signals.ts` — a same-directory or mirror-directory
 *    sibling file that didn't receive a matching change.
 *  - `unread-field-signals.ts` — an added interface/type-literal/class
 *    field with no read site anywhere in the indexed corpus.
 *
 * The design doc's gating-matrix row for this rule is explicit: build ONE
 * candidate loop unifying all three shapes under the SAME `ruleId`, not
 * three separate loops for one rule. This module does that: a single
 * `<incomplete_handling_candidates>` worklist interleaves candidates from
 * all three signals (each carrying its own `shape` tag and the evidence its
 * signal already computed), judged with one per-candidate-id-required
 * verdict contract — the same honesty mechanism the pilot's
 * `postProcessStaleDuplicateResult` established for the pr658 Finding-A
 * omission class (a long open worklist can under-report even inside a
 * dedicated, single-rule pass).
 *
 * ## Verdict vocabulary: four values, not the pilot's three
 *
 * The pilot's `stale | intentional-reuse | unverifiable` doesn't fit this
 * rule's three heterogeneous shapes as cleanly — a sibling-surface or
 * variant-sweep candidate can turn out to be handled via a code path the
 * signal's shallow textual match couldn't see (a helper function, a
 * differently-named consumer), which is a distinct disposition from "the
 * omission is deliberate" (an intentional catch-all default, a
 * structurally-incapable sibling). This module uses:
 *  - `incomplete` — the omission is real; converts to a finding.
 *  - `handled` — investigation shows it IS actually handled, just not in a
 *    way the textual signal could see (e.g. a dispatch table, a wrapper
 *    that reads the field indirectly).
 *  - `intentional` — the omission is a deliberate design choice (a
 *    catch-all default, a sibling that structurally cannot support the
 *    behavior, a documented gap).
 *  - `unverifiable` — investigation couldn't confirm either way (budget,
 *    or the evidence needed lives outside the indexed corpus).
 * Only `incomplete` becomes a finding; the other three are silent
 * dispositions the honesty contract still requires one of, per candidate.
 *
 * ## FP guard baked in from day one
 *
 * The stale-duplicate pilot's own eval found its loop wrongly flagging
 * decorative test-double/mock/fixture data (2/51) — a known-avoidable FP
 * class. This loop's prompt (`FP_GUARD` below) warns against it up front
 * rather than discovering it the same way a second time.
 *
 * ## Toolset: read_file + get_files_context + grep_codebase
 *
 * Unlike the pilot's stale-literal candidates (which carry an inline
 * snippet for every site), NONE of the three signals here attach a code
 * snippet to a consumer/sibling/declaration site — only `file:line` plus
 * metadata (which existing variants a consumer handles; which siblings
 * lack/share a pattern). Judging a candidate therefore requires actually
 * reading the referenced site, so `read_file` is load-bearing, not optional
 * — a harder requirement than the pilot's "sometimes can't disambiguate
 * from the snippet alone". `get_files_context` is added on top (not in the
 * pilot's toolset) because this rule's omission shapes are inherently
 * cross-file — "is the variant handled elsewhere?", "is the sibling
 * updated?" — and a file's imports/call sites/test associations are exactly
 * the structural view needed to judge whether an omission is handled via a
 * different mechanism (a dispatch table, a wrapper) that the signal's
 * token-level scan can't see. `grep_codebase` stays for the same reason the
 * pilot keeps it: a documented escape hatch when the signal's own textual
 * match (already a corpus-wide scan, more systematic than a one-off human
 * grep) still leaves a specific candidate ambiguous — e.g. a dynamic/
 * computed access the field-read patterns don't cover (see
 * `unread-field-signals.ts`'s own documented gap). `get_dependents` /
 * `list_functions` / `get_complexity` are still dropped: judging a handed
 * candidate is not a symbol-search or complexity-triage task.
