/**
 * Deterministic "unread field" signal for PR reviews — incomplete-handling's
 * THIRD omission shape.
 *
 * Provenance: the per-rule-loops design review (`.wip/per-rule-loops-design.md`,
 * gating-matrix row for `incomplete-handling`) names this as the one shape with
 * ZERO signal coverage today: `variant-sweep-signals.ts` covers added enum/
 * union/const-object VARIANTS, `sibling-surface-signals.ts` covers a feature
 * silently missing from a FAMILY MEMBER file — but a plain interface member /
 * type-literal property / class field that's declared and never read anywhere
 * ("the plumbing to the consumer was forgotten") has no precomputed candidate
 * list; the rule's own prompt (`rules.ts`, `INCOMPLETE_HANDLING`) just tells
 * the agent to "grep for all consumers" — the exact grep-and-reason anti-
 * pattern CLAUDE.md's design principle warns against, and this module's own
 * motivating example (`RuleTriggers.filePatterns`, `rules.ts`'s `example`
 * field) is EXACTLY this shape.
 *
 * The shape: a PR adds a member to an EXISTING or brand-new interface / type
 * literal / class (TS/JS v1 scope) that has no dot-access, bracket-access, or
 * destructuring reference anywhere else in the indexed corpus — only its own
 * declaration. Two steps, both deterministic:
 *   1. `computeAddedFields` — parse each changed file's diff for a genuinely
 *      new interface member / type-literal property / class field.
 *   2. `computeUnreadFieldCandidates` — for each added field, sweep the full
 *      indexed corpus (`repoChunks`) for a read site; keep only fields with
 *      none.
 *
 * ## Precision instrument, not recall instrument
 *
 * This is a "prove absence" signal, the hardest kind — a single missed read
 * pattern anywhere in a multi-hundred-chunk corpus is a false positive. Every
 * design choice below errs toward silence over a wrong candidate, per the
 * design brief: "when in doubt, suppress the candidate — the rule's LLM
 * judgment still exists without the signal."
 *
 *  - **Wholesale consumption (spread / `JSON.stringify` / serialization /
 *    shorthand-property hand-off).** If a `: TypeName` annotation has a
 *    spread (`...x`), `JSON.stringify(`, or — see below — a shorthand-
 *    property object-literal reference to the SAME annotated variable,
 *    within `WHOLESALE_PROXIMITY_CHARS` characters after it anywhere in the
 *    corpus, every field of that type is suppressed — we can't prove the
 *    field isn't consumed as part of a whole-object pass-through, so we
 *    don't claim it is unread. Deliberately type-level, not field-level (a
 *    narrower per-field check would need real data-flow tracking this module
 *    doesn't attempt), and proximity-based rather than a bare co-occurrence
 *    check: an earlier version matched the type name and a spread/stringify
 *    ANYWHERE in the same chunk, which false-fired on this module's OWN doc
 *    comment naming `RuleTriggers` (found via dogfooding) — requiring an
 *    actual type annotation, with comments masked out first, fixes that
 *    specific false-suppression while keeping the check textual (not real
 *    data-flow: the nearby spread/stringify need not touch the same
 *    variable the annotation introduced).
 *    The shorthand-property case is narrower and DOES tie back to the
 *    annotated variable's own name (mining sweep, hono #4451 ground truth):
 *    `app.fetch(req, { event, requestContext, context })` hands the whole
 *    `requestContext` value (typed `LatticeRequestContextV2`, carrying the
 *    PR's new `serviceNetworkArn` field) opaquely to another consumer via a
 *    bare shorthand property — not a spread, not `JSON.stringify`, so the
 *    original check missed it and flagged a real, actively-consumed field as
 *    unread. `{ requestContext }` reads as "hand off the CURRENT value of
 *    variable `requestContext`" the same way `...requestContext` would, so
 *    it counts as the same wholesale evidence — scoped to the specific
 *    variable name captured from the type annotation (`varName: TypeName`),
 *    not "any object literal with 2+ shorthand keys anywhere nearby".
 *  - **JSX attribute usage (`<div tw="...">`).** Read detection also
 *    recognizes the field name appearing as a JSX attribute on any element —
 *    invisible to the dot/bracket/destructure patterns above, since a JSX
 *    attribute is compiled to a prop key, never a `.field`/`['field']`
 *    access or a destructured binding in the SOURCE text. Motivating case
 *    (mining sweep, zod's OG-image generator): Satori's custom JSX renderer
 *    reads `HTMLAttributes.tw` (an inline-Tailwind escape hatch) exclusively
 *    via `<div tw="...">`-shaped call sites. Bounded to a fixed character
 *    window after the opening `<Tag` (mirrors the wholesale check's
 *    proximity design, and — per #810's ReDoS-hardening precedent —
 *    deliberately uses a BOUNDED quantifier rather than an unbounded `*`, so
 *    a minified file dense with `<`/`>` comparison operators can't make this
 *    pattern's worst case anything other than linear).
 *  - **Exported "public API" types.** A field on a type that's re-exported by
 *    an `index.ts`/`index.js` barrel is suppressed — its real consumers may
 *    live outside this indexed corpus (an external SDK consumer, or another
 *    package this review run didn't index). Two ways in: a NAMED export
 *    statement mentioning the type directly, or a wildcard `export * from
 *    '<specifier>'` whose specifier's basename matches the declaring file's
 *    own basename. That basename match is required, not optional — an
 *    earlier version treated ANY wildcard barrel found ANYWHERE in the
 *    corpus as evidence, which (found via dogfooding) suppressed every
 *    candidate in the entire codebase the moment a single, wholly unrelated
 *    package had its own ordinary `export * from './foo.js'` barrel — nearly
 *    universal in real code, and fatal to the signal's recall. It's still a
 *    coarse, corpus-wide textual check, not a per-package public-surface
 *    resolution: it can't tell a PUBLISHED package's real npm-facing barrel
 *    from a PRIVATE monorepo package's own internal `index.ts` (both look
 *    identical texturally), and a same-basename file in an unrelated
 *    directory can still false-match the wildcard form — so it still
 *    over-suppresses sometimes, just no longer catastrophically. A
 *    documented false-negative-prone simplification, not a bug: fewer
 *    candidates, never a wrong one.
 *  - **Test-fixture files.** A field declared in a file matching the test-path
 *    convention (`*.test.ts`, `__tests__/`, etc.) is skipped entirely — test
 *    fixture objects routinely carry properties the test itself never reads
 *    back out, and that's not a production bug.
 *  - **Generated `.d.ts` declaration files.** A field declared in a `.d.ts`
 *    file whose name carries a codegen marker (`-bundle`, `-generated`/
 *    `.generated.`, `.gen.`) or whose leading content carries a generator
 *    marker comment (`@generated`, `DO NOT EDIT`, "automatically generated")
 *    is skipped the same way a test-fixture file is. Motivating case (mining
 *    sweep, drizzle-kit): `grammar.ohm-bundle.d.ts`, an Ohm.js-generated
 *    grammar action-dictionary type listing EVERY grammar rule as an
 *    optional handler property — the exact same "declared, most never
 *    populated/read by any one consumer" shape as a test fixture, just for
 *    generated parser code instead. Deliberately narrow: a HAND-WRITTEN
 *    `.d.ts` (an ambient module declaration a person authored) carries
 *    neither signal and is NOT suppressed — blindly suppressing every
 *    `.d.ts` would hide real gaps in hand-authored type-only files.
 *  - **Dynamic/bracket access.** Read detection covers `obj.field`,
 *    `obj['field']`/`obj["field"]` (bracket string-literal key access), and
 *    both destructuring shapes (`const { field } = x`, `function f({ field })`)
 *    — not just the naive dot-access form other signals use for qualified
 *    enum/const-object references. A TRULY dynamic key (`obj[someVar]` where
 *    `someVar` happens to equal the field name at runtime) is undetectable
 *    statically and stays a documented gap.
 *
 * ## v1 scope, stated honestly
 *
 *  - TS/JS only (this repo's own surface, mirrors every other TS/JS-scoped
 *    signal in this file set).
 *  - Three declaration shapes: `interface X { field: T; }`, `type X = { field:
 *    T; }` (a DIRECT object-type-literal assignment only — `type X = A & {
 *    field: T }` or a generic-wrapped object type is not parsed, a documented
 *    gap, same tradeoff `variant-sweep-signals.ts` makes for its union shape),
 *    and a single-physical-line TYPED class property (`private readonly
 *    field: T;`, `field?: T;`, `field: T = default;`) — an untyped inferred
 *    field (`field = value;`, no `:`), a decorator-prefixed field
 *    (`@Input() field: T;`), or a multi-line field type are not detected;
 *    narrowing scope here trades recall for never misreading a getter/setter/
 *    method as a field (see `CLASS_PROPERTY_LINE_RE`'s doc for why).
 *  - Unlike `variant-sweep-signals.ts`, the containing declaration does NOT
 *    need to have existed before this PR — a brand-new interface whose field
 *    nobody reads is the same bug shape (the rule's own `RuleTriggers`
 *    example could plausibly have introduced `filePatterns` alongside a
 *    brand-new interface, not just added it to an old one).
 *  - This module does not verify the field is ever POPULATED (an object
 *    literal setting it, or a `.field = value` assignment) — it fires purely
 *    on "declared + never read". A field that's also never populated is
 *    arguably a smaller bug (dead code) than one that's silently populated
 *    and dropped, but distinguishing the two needs a construction-site trace
 *    this module doesn't attempt; left to the agent's own judgment.
 *  - A member is a genuine ADDITION using the same `isGenuinelyNew` technique
 *    `variant-sweep-signals.ts` uses: its identifier must not appear on a
 *    REMOVED line of this file's diff. A rename (old field removed, new one
 *    added) still counts as an addition — the same accepted overlap with
 *    `rename-sweep-signals.ts` variant-sweep documents for its own shape.
