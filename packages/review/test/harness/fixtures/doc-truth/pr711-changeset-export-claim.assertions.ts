/**
 * Snapshot from PR #711 ("chore: dead-code hygiene from the post-migration
 * audit (c8, EmbeddingError, stale example paths)") captured at the
 * planted-claim commit headSha 4480f85ed931 (base c7be7b68225b). The changeset
 * and the code it describes are in the same diff, so the claim is verifiable
 * from in-prompt material alone.
 *
 * Calibration status: 0/10 on `moonshotai/kimi-k2.7-code` (2026-07-11,
 * --calibrate 10). Traces show the model DOES investigate (greps remaining
 * EmbeddingError references, checks dependents in every vote) and then
 * declines to report — a defensible read, since the changeset's first
 * sentence discloses the removal and "otherwise" can honestly scope it out.
 * Ambiguous-on-merits; kept as a characterization fixture, not a canary.
 *
 * THE PLANTED CLAIM (touched prose, .changeset/remove-embedding-error.md):
 *   "Removed the unused embeddings-era `EmbeddingError` class and its
 *    `EMBEDDING_MODEL_FAILED`/`EMBEDDING_GENERATION_FAILED` error codes. …
 *    `LienErrorCode` and the public error exports are otherwise unchanged."
 * The changeset front-matter bumps `@liendev/core` as a **patch**.
 *
 * WHY IT'S FALSE / UNDERSTATED (contradicting code in the SAME diff):
 *   - packages/core/src/index.ts removes `EmbeddingError` from the package's
 *     public `export { … }` block (the `-  EmbeddingError,` line, right beside
 *     `LienErrorCode`). Removing a public export from `@liendev/core` is a
 *     BREAKING API change, not a patch.
 *   - packages/core/src/errors/codes.ts removes the `EMBEDDING_MODEL_FAILED`
 *     and `EMBEDDING_GENERATION_FAILED` members from the `LienErrorCode` enum.
 *   So "`LienErrorCode` and the public error exports are otherwise unchanged"
 *   glosses a breaking public-API removal: `LienErrorCode` lost two members and
 *   the public surface lost `EmbeddingError`, with no consumer migration path.
 *   (The real follow-up commit 0956f9e fixed exactly this: it deleted the
 *   "otherwise unchanged" sentence and replaced it with an explicit public-API
 *   removal note plus migration guidance — catch the `LienError` base class or
 *   a remaining `LienErrorCode`.)
 *
 * WHAT A CORRECT FINDING MUST SAY: quote the changeset's "public error exports
 * are otherwise unchanged" and flag that the diff removes `EmbeddingError` from
 * `@liendev/core`'s public exports (packages/core/src/index.ts) — a breaking
 * removal the `patch` bump / "unchanged" wording understates — and drops two
 * `LienErrorCode` members. Cite the removed `export { EmbeddingError }` line as
 * the falsifying fact.
 *
 * Capture command (fixture carries pr.headSha 4480f85ed931…, base c7be7b68…):
 *   npx tsx packages/review/test/harness/capture-pr.ts 711 \
 *     packages/review/test/harness/fixtures/doc-truth/pr711-changeset-export-claim.fixture.json \
 *     --sha 4480f85ed931e461a7591176d6a863a0aec750b8
 *
 * Structural note for calibration: `.changeset/**` is a doc-truth guidance
 * surface, so the changeset prose rides in <guidance_surface_changes>; the
 * index.ts / codes.ts removals are ordinary in-diff hunks. Everything the
 * finding needs is in-prompt — no blind read_file/grep dependency. One honest
 * ambiguity to watch: the changeset DISCLOSES the removal in its first sentence,
 * so a lenient reviewer may read "otherwise unchanged" as "other than the
 * disclosed removals" and stay quiet; the sharper, more defensible finding is
 * that a removed public export is breaking and the patch/"unchanged" framing
 * understates it. NOT tagged canary until a calibration baseline exists.
