## Quick Start

**1. Install Lien:**

```bash
npm install -g @liendev/lien
```

**2. Configure your editor:**

```bash
lien init
```

This writes the correct MCP config for your editor (Cursor, Claude Code, Windsurf, OpenCode, Kilo Code, or Antigravity).

**3. Restart your editor** and start asking questions about your codebase!

That's it—no configuration files needed. Lien auto-detects your project structure and indexes on first use.

## How It Works

1. **Index**: Lien scans your codebase, chunks code into manageable pieces, and generates embeddings using a local ML model
2. **Store**: Embeddings are stored in a local vector database in `~/.lien/indices/`
3. **Search**: When you query through Cursor, Lien finds the most semantically similar code chunks
4. **Context**: Results are returned to Cursor, providing better, context-aware responses

## Use Cases

- **Understand New Codebases**: "Show me how authentication works"
- **Find Implementations**: "Where are API endpoints defined?"
- **Locate Patterns**: "Find similar error handling code"
- **Discover Related Code**: "What tests cover this module?"
- **Tech Debt Analysis**: "What are the most complex functions?"
- **Impact Analysis**: "What depends on this file?"

## Privacy First

Lien is built with privacy as a core principle:

- All code analysis happens on your machine
- No data is sent to external servers
- No telemetry or usage tracking
- Open source and auditable

## Free & Open Source

Lien is licensed under AGPL-3.0 and **free forever for local use**. The license ensures:

- ✅ Use Lien locally without restrictions
- ✅ Modify and distribute freely
- ✅ Improvements benefit the community
- ✅ Sustainable long-term development
